# Runbook for Resolving Authentication Failure in E-commerce Store

## Overview
This runbook provides a step-by-step procedure for resolving authentication failures in an e-commerce platform. It is intended for use by DevOps or IT support teams.

## Pre-requisites
- Access to server logs (authentication service, database logs)
- Access to server management tools (for restarting services or servers)
- Basic understanding of the e-commerce platformâ€™s architecture

## Procedure

### Initial Assessment
1. **Verify the Incident**: Confirm the authentication failure reports.
2. **Check System Health**: Quickly review the overall health of the system (CPU, memory, disk space, network).

### Investigation
3. **Review Logs**: Check the authentication service logs for errors or unusual activity.
4. **Database Connectivity**: Ensure that the authentication service can connect to the database. Check for any recent changes to database credentials or network configurations.

### Immediate Mitigation
5. **Restart Authentication Service**:
   - **Action**: Restart the authentication service to see if it resolves the issue.
   - **Command**: Use the appropriate command or interface to restart the service. For example, `sudo systemctl restart auth-service`.
6. **Monitor the Service**: After restarting, monitor the logs for any immediate errors and check if the issue persists.

### Root Cause Analysis
7. **Analyze Error Patterns**: Look for patterns or specific error messages that might indicate the root cause.
8. **Database Health Check**: Ensure that the database server is running correctly. Check for high load, connectivity issues, or hardware problems.
9. **Consult with Database Team**: If database issues are suspected, escalate to the database team for deeper analysis.

### Resolution and Verification
10. **Implement Fix**: Based on the findings from the root cause analysis, implement the appropriate fix. This might involve configuration changes, code deployment, etc.
11. **Test Authentication**: Perform test logins to verify that the issue is resolved.
12. **User Communication**: Inform users (via status page, email, etc.) about the resolution.

### Post-Resolution
13. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the system for the next 24-48 hours to ensure stability.
14. **Document the Incident**: Update the incident log with the resolution details.
15. **Review and Update Runbook**: Based on the incident, review and update this runbook for accuracy and efficiency.

## Escalation
- If the issue is not resolved within the expected timeframe, escalate to senior DevOps team members or relevant department heads.
- In case of complex database issues, involve the Database Administration team immediately.

## Postmortem Analysis
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify the root cause and preventive measures.
- Document lessons learned and update systems or processes as necessary to prevent recurrence.
