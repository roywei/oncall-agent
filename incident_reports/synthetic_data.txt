Certainly! Here are three mock app error templates similar to the one you provided:

---

## Title: 
User Authentication Failure

## Error Name: 
Simulated Login Error

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:Backend Error: Login failed error | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:9000/ | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Backend Error: Incorrect credentials | Stack: Incorrect credentials | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Backend Error: Simulated Login Error | Stack: Error: Simulated Login Error
    at onUserLogin (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./services/authService.js:45:10)
    at handleRequest (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./controllers/authController.js:59:21)
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:95:5)

## Solution
The current onUserLogin function is throwing a simulated error for testing purposes, leading to authentication failures. To resolve this issue, remove the artificial error generation in the onUserLogin function and ensure that the normal login process is reinstated.

The file to modify: services/authService.js

Correct code:
```javascript
try {
    validateCredentials(username, password);
    // Additional logic for successful authentication
}
```

## Title: 
Product Details Fetching Error

## Error Name: 
Simulated Product Details Fetch Error

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:API Error: Product fetch error | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/123 | Info: {}
ERROR:root:API Error: Invalid product ID | Stack: Invalid product ID | Info: {}
ERROR:root:API Error: Simulated Product Details Fetch Error | Stack: Error: Simulated Product Details Fetch Error
    at fetchProductDetails (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./api/products.js:34:11)
    at getProductDetails (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./controllers/productController.js:27:18)

## Solution
The fetchProductDetails function is intentionally generating a fetch error. To resolve this, remove the simulated error code and ensure the function correctly fetches product details from the database or external service.

The file to modify: api/products.js

Correct code:
```javascript
async function fetchProductDetails(productId) {
    // Implementation to fetch and return product details
}
```

## Title: 
Checkout Process Interruption

## Error Name: 
Simulated Checkout Failure

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:Checkout Error: Checkout process failure | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:8000/checkout | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Checkout Error: Payment gateway error | Stack: Payment gateway error | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Checkout Error: Simulated Checkout Failure | Stack: Error: Simulated Checkout Failure
    at processCheckout (webpack-internal:///(app-client)/./pages/checkout.js:88:24)
    at submitOrder (webpack-internal:///(app-client)/./components/checkoutForm.js:76:5)

## Solution
The checkout process is disrupted due to an intentional error in the processCheckout function. To fix this, the artificial error generation should be removed and the standard checkout flow should be reinstated.

The file to modify: pages/checkout.js

Correct code:
```javascript
try {
    processPayment(details);
    completeOrder(orderData);
}
```

## Title:
Email Sending Error

## Error Name:
Simulated Email Sending Error

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:Email Sending Error: Unable to send email | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/email/123 | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Email Sending Error: Invalid recipient address | Stack: Invalid recipient address | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Email Sending Error: Simulated Email Sending Error | Stack: Error: Simulated Email Sending Error
at sendEmail (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./api/email.js:25:12)
at notificationController (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./controllers/notificationController.js:19:18)

## Solution
The sendEmail function is intentionally generating an email sending error. To resolve this, remove the simulated error code and ensure the function correctly sends emails to the specified recipient.

The file to modify: api/email.js

Correct code:
```javascript
async function sendEmail(emailDetails) {
    // Implementation to send an email based on emailDetails
}
```

## Title:
Payment Processing Error

## Error Name:
Simulated Payment Processing Error

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:Payment Processing Error: Unable to process payment | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/payment/123 | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Payment Processing Error: Insufficient funds | Stack: Insufficient funds | Info: {}
ERROR:root:Payment Processing Error: Simulated Payment Processing Error | Stack: Error: Simulated Payment Processing Error
at processPayment (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./api/payment.js:19:14)
at checkoutController (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./controllers/checkoutController.js:28:22)

## Solution
The processPayment function is intentionally generating a payment processing error. To resolve this, remove the simulated error code and ensure the function correctly processes payments and handles various payment scenarios.

The file to modify: api/payment.js

Correct code:
```javascript
async function processPayment(paymentDetails) {
    // Implementation to process payment based on paymentDetails
}
```

## Title:
File Upload Error

## Error Name:
Simulated File Upload Error

## Stack trace
ERROR:root:File Upload Error: Unable to upload file | Stack: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/upload/123 | Info: {}
ERROR:root:File Upload Error: Invalid file format | Stack: Invalid file format | Info: {}
ERROR:root:File Upload Error: Simulated File Upload Error | Stack: Error: Simulated File Upload Error
at handleFileUpload (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./api/upload.js:28:15)
at processFile (webpack-internal:///(app-server)/./controllers/uploadController.js:42:22)

## Solution
The handleFileUpload function is intentionally generating a file upload error. To resolve this, remove the simulated error code and ensure the function correctly processes and uploads files to the specified location.

The file to modify: api/upload.js

## Correct code:
```javascript
async function handleFileUpload(file) {
    // Implementation to handle file upload and save it to the desired location
}
```
